# OneBitePizza
The One Bite Pizza Review project is a data project created by Jason Borucki to analyze the pizza that former Barstool Presidente Dave Portnoy has eaten throughout the years.

The only file attached is a Jupyter Notebook that scrapes all 1500+ pizza reviews for visualization in software such as Tableau or PowerBI. 

I am currently working on the visualization part and a link will be up when that is finished.
